## How Many <abbr title="Incentive Stock Options">ISOs</abbr> Can I
Afford?

This site helps you calculate how may incentive stock options (ISOs) you can
afford. The great thing about ISOs is the strike price -- you get to buy
shares for less than they're worth. The bad thing is that the IRS sees
that difference as profit and taxes you on it.
